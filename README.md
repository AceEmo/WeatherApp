# WeatherApp
A simple and intuitive weather application that provides real-time weather information for any city around the world. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this app allows users to quickly check the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and more.

API Integration: This app uses the [OpenWeatherMap API]((https://openweathermap.org/)) to fetch weather data. You'll need to replace the API_KEY in the JavaScript file with your own API key.
